CIS183_Final
This Android app is a meal planning & shopping app. The app is intended to allow the user to meal plan at the beginning of their week and generate a grocery list based on the items they have in their kitchen (pantry) and the items that they still need to fulfill the recipe needs.

Problems:
•	I think I made my scope too big. I should have stuck with something smaller.
•	I wasn’t able to finish the application the way that I wanted to. The user, recipe, and pantry ingredient CRUD works; however, I was unable to get the meal plan portion to work.
•	I wasn’t able to change the colors. The way that I knew how to do it (through themes) makes the navigation bar black and the user would not be able to see the icons available to them.
•	I wasn’t fully grasping the database in the beginning. I could modify previously constructed code that we did in class and make it work, but I didn’t understand what I was doing. Sometime earlier this week it just clicked and now I can work through the problems in my head a lot faster and write the code without referencing my previous code. I think I like databases now.
